# GameTest
Hi everyone, I'm not english so I don't speak english very much :)
This game is my first big project in c++
My game isn't a good exemple, there are a lot of bad code ^^

For the moment in the game you can just defeat a spider (araign√©e in french) 
  and sell the string which you drop on them to the seller (vendeur in french)
  And of course there are no graphics, the game is played in a terminal :)
  I'm not sure if the game can be played on Windows

To launch the game use 'make' and then 'make file' or './fighter'
